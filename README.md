# Countries
I am getting country names from rapidapi with api call and than listing these country names on the main page. When clicked any row , detail page will be open with relative country code and  country flag which being taking with another api call to get image Url and show this image on the imageVeiw . I have used to  KingFisher and SvgKit which are third party library to view image. When clicked on the get more information button , relative wikidata page will be open to more information. Lasty, user can add country to favorite page and detele from this page that country.

I have used this techniques at this project ; Api's and Json Parse, singleton design pattern, Mvc, Protocol and Delegates, KingFisher(Third Party Library), SvgKit(Third Party Library),Extensions. 
Also i have written descriptions near the code lines.
